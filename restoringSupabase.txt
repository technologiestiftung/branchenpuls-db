Notes on how to fully resore Supabase 

set up db locally
set up all tables and function
download all data to tempData folder
run the script for each month starting with the first month and then in ORDER
connect to Supabase and delete all content from table (lookup tables can be ignored if nothing changed)
Delete like so: DELETE FROM business;
Make a Backup of you local DB using PG Admin 4: 
    - Format: Custom
    - Type of Object: Only Data
    - Do not save: Owner (and all others)
Connect to Supabase with PG Admin and RESTORE with same setting as Backup
    - The lookup tables will fail because if not deleted before
    - You might get an error:
        pg_restore: error: COPY failed for table "branch": ERROR: insert or update on table "branch" violates foreign key constraint "fk_branch_business"
        DETAIL: Key (opendata_id)=(943012271374) is not present in table "business".

        This is because branch needs to be created after business. Make a separate Backup of branch and upload it again.
